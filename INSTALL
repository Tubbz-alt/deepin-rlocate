INSTALL
-------

       Before you start, check that you have Linux kernel version 2.6, and
       "Enable different security models" is set and "Default Linux Capabili-
       ties" is either unset or set to 'M' in your kernel configuration in
       "Security options" section. Disable also NSA SELinux. You can add
       selinux=0 in your boot loader config file. In grub that would be -
       /boot/grub/menu.lst.

       First unpack the archive rlocate-0.5.6.tar.gz.

       Enter the rlocate-0.5.6 directory and type:

               ./configure
               make
               su -c "make install"

       After that, load the rlocate kernel module as root, for example with:

               modprobe rlocate

       Or you can use some mechanism of your distribution to load the module
       at boot time.

       You need to start rlocated daemon as root too. You can use some of the
       init scripts in contrib directory for your distribution.

               /etc/init.d/rlocate start

       Run
               /etc/cron.daily/rlocate

       as root or wait for cron job and you have locate that is always
       up-to-date.

       It will hopefully compile and it works. If it doesn't you can either
       email me <e9526925@stud3.tuwien.ac.at> or make a patch and send it to
       me.
