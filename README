     ABOUT
     -------

     rlocate is a locate that is always up-to-date. The database that original
     locate uses, is usually updated only once a day and the newer files cannot 
     be located right away. The behavior from rlocate is the same as slocate, 
     but it also contains diff database that gets updated every time a file is 
     created or directory is moved.

     rlocate kernel module can be compiled only with 2.6.* kernels.

     PORTS
     -----
     
     rlocate will work only on Linux with version 2.6. 
     
     Listed below are the known and tested platforms that rlocate will work on.
