        rlocate for Linux (2.6 Kernel)</pre>
<pre>
        Released January 27, 2005
        Copyright (c) 2004,2005 Rasto Levrinc
        Based on slocate by Kevin Lindsay</pre>
<p>rlocate is an implementation of the ``locate'' command that is always up-to-date.
The database that the original locate uses is usually updated only once a day,
so newer files cannot be located right away. The behavior of rlocate is the
same as slocate, but it also maintains a diff database that gets updated
whenever a new file is created. This is accomplished with rlocate kernel module
and daemon. The rlocate kernel module can be compiled only with Linux 2.6 
kernels.</p>
<p>If you are interested how it is done internally, here is how:</p>
<p>rlocate.ko is kernel module, that can be compiled and insmoded to the
kernel. It has hooks for link, mkdir, mknod, open, rename and symlink 
system calls with help of lsm. It stores filenames to the internal list. 
Since all the file names have slash in the beginning it is replaced either
with 'a' or 'm' depending on if a file or directory is added or directory
is moved in the filesystem. Reason for that is, that directories that are
renamed must be traversed in the rlocate daemon later.</p>
<p>The module communicates with rlocate daemon with help of /dev/rlocate 
device file. It writes all the file names with one file name per line to 
this device file.</p>
<p>rlocated is a daemon that reads /dev/rlocate device file and writes the
paths without leading '/' to the rlocate diff database. It does that every 
2 seconds. 
If a directory was moved, it will be traversed and entries in the directory and
its subdirectories are written to the diff database.</p>
<p>The locate command searches in rlocate database, which is the same as 
original slocate database, diff database and temporal diff database. The 
diff databases contain file names were added to the filesystem.</p>
<p>During the search also the file names are checked if they are accessible. 
If a file name was removed, it is not accessible, so it will be not shown.</p>
<p>The diff database is copied to temporal diff database 
and is emptied in the beginning of the updatedb and the temporal diff 
database is removed after updatedb is done. The reason for that is, so 
that also during updatedb is running, which can take several minutes, the 
locate command returns the correct results.</p>
<p>updatedb should be run daily e.g. as a cron job same as with slocate. Otherwise 
the searches would become slower with time.</p>
<p>updatedb runs in two modes - fast update or full update. Fast update takes 2 to 
10 seconds to complete. Full update takes several minutes. The drawback of fast 
update is, that the database becomes more or less larger each day, since it
contains also file names, that were removed. Fast update is run automatically
every time, except the first time and every tenth time updatedb is started.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="kernel_configuration">Kernel configuration</a></h1>
<p>Before you start, check that you have Linux kernel version 2.6, and
``Enable different security models'' is set to yes.</p>
<p>At the moment the stacking with other security modules is not implemented, so 
it is not possible to load other security modules with rlocate.</p>
<p>The ``Default Linux Capabilities'' must be either disabled or set to 'M' in your 
kernel configuration in ``Security options'' section. Capability module cannot be 
loaded at the same time as rlocate. Disable also NSA SELinux.</p>
<p>You can add selinux=0 in your boot loader config file. In grub that 
would be - /boot/grub/menu.lst.</p>
<p>If you don't, you get this error later by insmoding the module:</p>
<pre>
        FATAL: Error inserting rlocate
        (/lib/modules/2.6.9-1.667/misc/rlocate.ko): Invalid argument</pre>
<p>Capabilities and SELinux are usually enabled by default in newest Debian, RedHat,
SuSE etc. distributions and you would have to recompile the kernel.
This problem will be probably solved in the future, when better stacking of
security modules is possible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="installation_from_tarball">Installation from tarball</a></h1>
<p>First unpack the archive rlocate-x.x.x.tar.gz.</p>
<p>Enter the rlocate-x.x.x directory and type:</p>
<pre>
        ./configure
        make
        su -c &quot;make install&quot;</pre>
<p>After that, load the rlocate kernel module as root, for example with:</p>
<pre>
        modprobe rlocate</pre>
<p>Or you can use some mechanism of your distribution to load the module at 
boot time.</p>
<p>You need to start rlocated daemon as root too. You can use some of the init 
scripts in contrib directory for your distribution.</p>
<pre>
        /etc/init.d/rlocate start</pre>
<p>Run</p>
<pre>
        /etc/cron.daily/rlocate</pre>
<p>as root or wait for cron job and you have locate 
that is always up-to-date.</p>
<p>It will hopefully compile and it works. If it doesn't you can either email 
me &lt;<a href="mailto:e9526925@stud3.tuwien.ac.at">e9526925@stud3.tuwien.ac.at</a>&gt; or make a patch and send it to me.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="uninstall">Uninstall</a></h1>
<p>Enter the rlocate-x.x.x directory and type:</p>
<pre>
        su -c &quot;make uninstall&quot;</pre>

<h1><a name="installing_debian_packages">Installing debian packages</a></h1>
<p>There are two debian packages,</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rlocate_2dsource">rlocate-source</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>provides the source for the kernel modules.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can install it using the make-kpkg(1) command provided by the kernel-package 
Debian package. This will produce a corresponding rlocate-module package for
the Debian kernel-image package that you are using. This is ``the Debian
way''. See the ``modules_image'' section of the make-kpkg(1) man page.
Notice that you have to be root to build the rlocate-module.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You need to have kernel-image-2.6.x installed for following.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>First install source package as root</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>dpkg -i rlocate-source_x.x.x_all.deb</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This will install rlocate.tar.gz to the /usr/src directory. Untar it
</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>

tar xvzpf rlocate.tar.gz</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Change to /usr/src/linux-2.6.x directory and make modules image</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>make-kpkg modules_image</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Install rlocate module</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>dpkg -i /usr/src/rlocate-module-... i386.deb</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rlocate">rlocate</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>provides user-space applications for searching the file names in the database.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can install it with following command</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>dpkg -i rlocate_x.x.x_i386.deb</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>After that, you need to create the database and you are done.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>/etc/cron.daily/rlocate</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="setting_up_rlocate_manually">Setting up rlocate manually</a></h1>
<p>1. If the make install does not work, a manual setup  will have to
be done.  The first thing to do is copy the rlocate binary
to a directory in your path.  Usually the directory:</p>
<pre>
        /usr/local/bin/</pre>
<p>will suffice.
</p>
<pre>

2. Next you must create a group called:</pre>
<pre>
        rlocate</pre>
<p>You can do this by either editing the /etc/group file manually or use
a group add utility.  The following is supported by Linux:</p>
<pre>
        groupadd rlocate</pre>
<p>3. Once the group has been created, you must now change the ownership and
permissions of the rlocate and rlocated binaries. To do this execute 
the following commands.</p>
<pre>
        chown 0:rlocate /usr/local/bin/rlocate
        chmod 2755 /usr/local/bin/rlocate
        
        chown 0:0 /usr/local/sbin/rlocated 
        chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/rlocated</pre>
<p>4. To make rlocate more convenient to use, you can symlink 'rlocate' to 
'locate'.</p>
<p>Move the old version of locate to something else if it exists.</p>
<pre>
        ln -s /usr/local/bin/rlocate /usr/local/bin/locate</pre>
<p>5. To make updating the database more convenient, you may link 'rlocate'
to 'updatedb'.  This way, just running 'updatedb' will start to index
your entire drive.</p>
<pre>
        ln -s /usr/local/bin/rlocate /usr/local/bin/updatedb</pre>
<p>6. Then you have to make sure this path exits:</p>
<pre>
        /usr/local/var/rlocate/</pre>
<p>You can do this by executing this command:</p>
<pre>
        mkdir -p /usr/local/var/rlocate</pre>
<p>Now just give it the right ownership:</p>
<pre>
        chown 0:rlocate /usr/local/var/rlocate</pre>
<p>7. Then you have to load rlocate.ko module from rlocate-module directory. 
You can copy it to:</p>
<pre>
        /lib/modules/2.6.x/misc/</pre>
<p>directory and make sure, that module is loaded at boot time. How it is 
done depends on your linux distribution. Change 2.6.x to your kernel 
version. ``Enable different security models'' must be set and ``Default
Linux Capabilities'' must be unset or set to ``M'' in your kernel
configuration in ``Security options'' section. Disable also NSA SELinux.
You can add selinux=0 in your boot loader config file. In grub that would
be - /boot/grub/menu.lst.</p>
<p>8. Now you need init script to start rlocated daemon from rlocate-daemon 
directory. Some example init scripts are in contrib directory.
You should copy it to /etc/init.d directory or something like that.</p>
<p>Copy the rlocated binary for example in:</p>
<pre>
        /usr/local/sbin</pre>
<p>directory.</p>
<p>9. Create a /dev/rlocate device file if you are not using udev or devfs.
You will have to look in kernel log file after loading the rlocate
module for major number. You can do it with this command:</p>
<pre>
        mknod /dev/rlocate c 254 0</pre>
<p>where 254 is major number, that can be different on your computer.</p>

<h1><a name="creating_the_database">Creating the database</a></h1>
<p>When creating the database, there are a few options that you may
use to customize which files get indexed and how.  The database will be
stored in /var/lib/rlocate/. The two main options are:</p>
<pre>
        -u       - Indexes every file on your system.
        -U &lt;dir&gt; - Indexes every file in the directory &lt;dir&gt;.</pre>
<p>Below are some examples of different types of indexing options:</p>
<p>Create an index of every file in every directory on your system.</p>
<pre>
        rlocate -u</pre>
<p>Create an index of every file in the specified directory &lt;dir&gt;.</p>
<pre>
        rlocate -U &lt;dir&gt;</pre>
<p>Create an index of every file excluding the specified files/directories,
/proc /dev and /tmp</p>
<pre>
        rlocate -e &quot;/proc,/dev/,/tmp&quot; -u</pre>
<p>Create an index of every file excluding files on NFS and iso9660 type
filesystems.</p>
<pre>
        rlocate -f &quot;NFS,iso9660&quot; -u</pre>
<p>If you symlinked /usr/local/bin/rlocate to /usr/local/bin/updatedb, 
then executing the updatedb command will automatically index the root 
filesystem starting at '/'.  This will also cause the file 
'/etc/updatedb.conf' to be parsed.  This file is in the same format as 
the original updatedb.sh configuration file.</p>
<p>
